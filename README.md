## This is the skeleton of a Go service that performs CRUD operations for companies.

The service is not usable. 

I have implemented the handler functions but did not have time to test my solution.

Also, there is no JWT authentication and Kafka integration as I am not familiar with the topics and did not have enough time to research them sufficiently.
Although not usable, I submit this assignment as it holds my thoughts and ideas on how I would have tackled this problem.

For the database, I used sqlite through GORM, an ORM library for Go.
